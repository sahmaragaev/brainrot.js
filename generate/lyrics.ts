	"Maybe in this song, you shouldn't start by saying\nNigga, I said it, I know that you mad\nI've emptied the clip over friendlier jabs\nYou mentioned my seed, now deal with his dad\nI gotta go bad, I gotta go bad\nMm, mm, yeah\n\nDrop, drop, drop, drop\nDrop a fifty bag for the mob in the spot\nDrop a fifty bag, 29 for the thot\nUh, I was really, really tryna keep it PG\nI was really, really tryna keep it PG\nIf you had a set, they'd give your ass a DP\nBut you civilian gang, in real life, you PC\n\nYou know who really bang a set? My nigga YG\nYou know who really bang a set? My nigga Chuck T\nYou know who even bang a set out there is CB\nAnd, nigga, Cole losin' sleep on this, it ain't me\n\nYou better have some paperwork or that shit fake tea\nCan't be rappin' 'bout no rattin' that we can't read\nI mean, it's true a nigga slimed me for my AP\nJust like how Metro nigga slimed him for his main squeeze\n\nOut here beggin' for attention, nigga, say please\nAlways rappin' like you 'bout to get the slaves freed\nYou just actin' like an activist, it's make-believe\nDon't even go back to your hood and plant no money trees\n\nSay you hate the girls I fuck, but what you really mean?\nI been with Black and White, and everything that's in between\nYou the Black messiah wifin' up a mixed queen\nAnd hit vanilla cream to help out with your self-esteem\n\nOn some Bobby shit, I wanna know what Whitney need\nAll that puppy love was over in y'all late teens\nWhy you never hold your son and tell him, \"Say cheese\"?\nWe could've left the kids out of this, don't blame me\n\nYou a dog and you know it, you just play sweet\nYour baby mama captions always screamin', \"Save me\"\nYou did her dirty all your life, you tryna make peace\nI heard that one of 'em little kids might be Dave Free\n\nDon't make it Dave Free's\n'Cause if your GM is your BM secret BD\nThen this is all makin' plenty fuckin' sense to me\n\nAy, let that shorty breathe\nShake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees\nHands on your knees, hands on your knees\nShake that ass for Drake, now shake that ass for free\n\nYuh, yeah\nWell, not that kind of free, I'm talkin' 'bout my nigga Dave\nYour man a lil' K, we call that shit a mini Drac'\nHe always said I overlooked him, I was starin' straight\nThese bars go over Kenny head, no matter what I say\n\nI know you like to keep it short, so let me paraphrase\nKnew it was smoke when Abel hit us with the serenade\nNigga said, \"Uh, uh\"\nAlmost started reachin' for my waist\n\nDrop, drop, drop, drop\nDrop a fifty bag for the mob in the spot\nDrop a fifty bag, 29 for the thot\nUh, I was really, really tryna keep it-\n\nYeah\nLet's stop playin' around and take this shit serious, man\nNiggas is a joke, I take it serious, though\nYeah, look\n\nIf Drake shooters doin' TikToks, nigga\nRealest shooter in your gang, that's P's brother\nY'all ain't getting shit shot, nigga\nI can't listen to the stick talk in falsetto\nSave it for a hip-hop nigga\nYou don't even be at home, dog\nYou a souvenir-out-the-gift-shop nigga\nStill mad about that one ho, we ain't even fuck\nI just lip-locked with her\n\nI get active when it's wartime\nI ain't even really let my dick drop, nigga\nWhat the fuck I heard Rick drop, nigga?\nTalkin' somethin' 'bout a nose job, nigga\nOzempic got a side effect of jealousy\nAnd doctor never told y'all niggas\nPut a nigga in the bars, let a nigga rot\n\nKind of like your old job, nigga\nHouse sittin' on some land\nBut it's out where no one even really know y'all niggas\nBitches gotta drive two hours 'fore you pay 'em\nJust to give a blowjob, nigga\nMust've snorted up a snowball\n'Cause my last record deal was 400 M's\nThese days, that's a low ball, nigga, ay\n\nWho's next on the list?\nWhich one of my so-called niggas\nWhich one of my so-called niggas\nWhich one of my so-called niggas\nNeed a shell from the clip?\nAlways knew I had to smoke y'all niggas\n\ngood kid, m.A.A.d city van\nWe'll pop the latch and let the door slide\nTears runnin' down my cheek\nLaughin' at you pussies dyin', it's a war cry\nWeeknd music gettin' played in all the spots\nWhere boys got a little more pride\nThat's why all your friends dippin' to Atlanta\nPayin' just to find a tour guide\n\nAbel, run your fuckin' bread\nNeed to buy some more chains for some more guys\nLet me find another street nigga\nI can take to the game courtside\nLet me get a used Ferrari for a rapper\nTake the nigga on a horse ride\nAnything to take the spotlight off the fact\nThe boss is a drugged-out lil' punk sissy from the Northside\n\nRakim talkin' shit again\nGassed 'cause you hit my BM first\nNigga, do the math, who I was hittin' then?\nI ain't even know you rapped still\n'Cause they only talkin' 'bout your 'fit again\nProbably gotta have a kid again\n'Fore you think of droppin' any shit again\n\nEven when you do drop, they gon' say\nYou should've modeled 'cause it's mid again\nSmokin' Fenty 'bout it\nShould've put you on the first one, tryna get it in\nAsk Fring if this a good idea\nThe next time you cuddled in that bed again\nShe'll even tell you leave the boy alone\n'Fore you get your head split again\n\nPluto shit make me sick to my stomach\nWe ain't never really been through it\nLeland Wayne, he a fuckin' lame\nSo I know he had to be an influence\nThese niggas had a plan and they finally\nFound a way to rope you into it\nTwo separate albums dissin', I just did a Kim to it\nNigga, skim through it\n\nMe and Savage had the hoes drippin' wet at shows\nAlmost had to swim to it\nK.Dot shit is only hittin' hard when\nBaby Keem put his pen to it\nRoss callin' me the White boy\nAnd the shit kind of got a ring to it\n'Cause all these rappers wavin' white flags\nWhile the whole fuckin' club sing to it\n\nMurder scene on your man tonight\nThen come to the vigil with the candlelight\nBody after fuckin' body and you know Rick\nReadin' my Miranda rights\nI'm goin' on vacation now, I hope next time, y'all plan it right\n'Cause you gotta pay for sayin' my name\nGuess now niggas understand the price\nNigga, what? (6ix)\n\nAy, Kendrick just opened his mouth\nSomeone go hand him a Grammy right now\nWhere is your uncle at?\n'Cause I wanna talk to the man of the house\nWest Coast niggas do fades, right?\nCome get this ass whoopin', I'm handin' 'em out\nYou wanna take up for Pharrell?\nThen come get his legacy out of my house\n\nA cease-and-desist is for hoes\nCan't listen to lies that come out of your mouth\nYou called the Tupac estate\nAnd begged 'em to sue me and get that shit down\nI'm losin' perspective on beef\nBoi-1da send beat and I'll kill you for fun\nYour daddy got robbed by Top\nYou Stunna and Wayne, like father, like son\n\nAnthony set up the plays, Kojo be chargin'\nYou double for nothin'\nThey shook about what I'ma say\nBut textin' your phone like, \"We already won\"\nYou tell me what I shouldn't say\nBut fuck it, my nigga, it's already done\nWe already know it's a twenty-v-one\nWe already know why you went number one\n\nIt's clearly because of The Boy\nThe honorable thing is to give me the loot\nYou right about \"Fuck the big three\"\nIt's only Big D, and there's video proof\nOur sons should go play at the park\nTwo light skin kids, that shit would be cute\nUnless you don't want to be seen\nWith anyone that isn't Blacker than you\n\nWe get it, we got it\nThe Blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nWe get that you like to put gin in your juice\nWe get that you think that you Bishop in Juice\nWhen you put your hands on your girl\nIs it self-defense 'cause she bigger than you?\nYour back is up against the curb\nYou diggin' for dirt, should be diggin' for proof\n\nWhy did you move to New York?\nIs it 'cause you livin' that bachelor life?\nProposed in 2015\nBut don't wanna make her your actual wife\nI'm guessin' this wedding ain't happenin', right?\n'Cause we know the girls that you actually like\nYour darkest secrets are comin' to light\nIt's all on your face like what happened to Mike\n\nOh, shit, it's all makin' sense\nMaybe I'm Prince and you actually Mike\nMichael was prayin' his features would change\nSo people believe that he's actually White\nTop would make you do features for change\nGet on pop records and rap for the Whites\nAnd wait, you say your brother Jermaine\nBut you wanted him to stay out of the light\n\nOh, shit, just follow me, right?\n'Cause nothin' you sayin' could bother me, right?\nI get off the plane and nothing has changed\nI head to Delilah with all of my ice\nHead to Delilah with all of my ice\nHead to Delilah with all of my ice\nThis shit gotta be over by now\nFor anyone out here that's calling it, right?\n\nYou're dead\nYou're dead, you're dead\nThere's nowhere to hide, there's nowhere to hide\nYou know what I mean\nThey hired a crisis management team\nTo clean up the fact that you beat on your queen\nThe picture you painted ain't what it seem\nYou're dead";
